### How to use the data in this folder
Each folder represents a different ACS data table. In this project we will be using three tables:

* DP03 provides information about employment and income
  * DP03_0009PE is the variable for unemployment rate
* B01003 provides information about population
  * B01003_001E is the variable for population
* B02001 provides information about ethnicity
* B15003 provides information about educational attainment
* B00002 provides a count of housing units
* B25056 provides information about average rents
* B25075 provides information about home values

The file tractdata.csv contains information on most of the above variables for every census tract in Los Angeles County.
